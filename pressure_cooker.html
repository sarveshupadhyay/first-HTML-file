        <p> Each pressure cooker made by Hawkins features an inside-fitting lid. This design is inherently safer than conventional pressure cookers. To open any Hawkins cooker, you have to first lower the lid slightly into the body of the cooker; and that cannot be done until the steam pressure inside the cooker falls to a safe level. Thus Hawkins pressure cookers are pressure-locked for safety - like a jetliner door!</p>
        <br/>
        <p> Hawkins offers 85 different pressure cooker models in twelve different types. Click on any of the twelve types shown below to learn more about the features, benefits and models of that particular type.</p>
